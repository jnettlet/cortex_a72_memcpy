A simple memcpy replacement that only changes the orderig of
2 stores in the 96 byte code path in order to fix an issue when
copying from userspace to memmapped device memory like framebuffers
or perhaps when using a toolkit like SPDK.

The build is done just by issueing the make command and then you
can copy the libmemcpy.so to any preferred library path.

The library can be tested by using LD_PRELOAD="./libmemcpy.so" application
or be made globablly available by adding the full path to the library
into the file /etc/ld.so.preload.
